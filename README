Shopify Front End Dev intern for fall 2018
by Sibilu Baissa

Here is my answer for the front-end-developer-challenge for fall 2018

below is the the HTML, SCSS and JavaScript files for the webpage

i was not able to get the web page up and running because of time limit and i started working on the web app a bit late 

but i have worked on the User interface, to view the interface just open HTML file with a browser of your preference

you can also view the javascript code to see my approcah and how far i got in the challenge

Hope this doesnot disqualify me from the job

Thank you
